Man, I fucking hate sharealike licenses. I used to be so excited about them, and then I realized I was pushing a mostly-hopeless theory of legal change on a world that had occasionally legitimate reasons for not listening. I was creating deadweight loss, depriving others of productivity and wealth and enjoyment they could have had at no cost to me. The only person getting anything out of the arrangement was me: I was satisfying my own naive idealism and prescriptive paternalism. But once I realized I was being an asshole, even _I_ didn't get anything out of it. So I stopped.

Anyway this project is licensed GPLv2 despite the foregoing because that's the license the Inkscape plugin code came with and having split licenses is a pain. However, if you find it convenient, you may also consider all material in this repo other thank the files in `inkscape/*` to be dual-licensed under both GPLv2 and BSD 3-clause. The text of both licenses is provided below.
